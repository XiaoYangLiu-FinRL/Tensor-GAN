# Tensor GAN

## Introduction
- The codes are in the repository `./TGAN`.

## Usage
Basicly, we select MNIST dataset as an example.
- Firstly, run `GAN.py` to train a generative model which is used to generate low-quality tensors with size `14 * 14 * 7` from a random distribution. 
- Secondly, run `gen_training_data.py`, which is used to generate training data consists of pairs of low-quality images and high-qulity images. As downscaled from the original MNIST images with size `28 * 28`, the low-quality image is of size `14 * 14 * 7`, which is concated by single images shifted with different pixels. 
- Then, run `./SR/D_Training.m` to train a combined tensor dictionary.
- Lastly, run `gen_test_data.py` to use GANs to generate low-quality images. And run `./SR/Demo_SR.m` to generate high-qulity images.

## Experiment
We have tested the high-quality image generation from a low-resolution image via tensor combined dictionary.

And the following pictures are the generated handwritten numbers the model. The above pictures are generated from latent representations by a generator, which is composed of an adversarial autoencoder networks. The pictures at the bottom are generated by our tensor superresolution (essentially tensor sparse coding) from the above pictures.
